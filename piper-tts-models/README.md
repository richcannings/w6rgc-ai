Before running the application, please make sure you have downloaded the 
Piper voice files and updated the TTS_PIPER_MODEL_PATH in constants.py 
with the correct path to the .onnx file. 

The default model is: 

https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main/en/en_US/lessac/medium

Download en_US-lessac-medium.onnx and en_US-lessac-medium.onnx.json and
put them in this directory.

You can find more voice models at:

https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main.

Remember that both the .onnx and .onnx.json files for your chosen voice
must be in the same directory.
